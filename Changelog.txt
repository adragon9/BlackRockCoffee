- Classes.py
    - I added custom classes to streamline creating two tkinter objects, entry boxes and buttons
        - On request I can add more objects in this fashion

- main.py
    - I changed the window implementation so that the window spawned from main.py is a root window
      this will allow us to easily implement any new windows we need in the future.

    - I changed how the splash page's layout works, it now uses the canvas functions for more fine-tuned
      control over object placement in the window.
        - As a side note I also locked the window from being resized.

- Queue.py
    - I changed root = tk.Tk() to root = tk.TopLevel() to make it the focus window upon pressing the button
      to create it.

    - I added root.grab_set() which essentially makes it so you can only interact with that window even if
      other windows are open.

- I also added a changelog because I made to many changes to put in the commit comments
